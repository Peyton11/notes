# CPSC:435 Algorithms Introduction

**Algorithm**- A procedure for solving computational problem (ex. sorting a set of integers) in a finite number of steps. More specifically: a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing something (especially using a computer).  

## Solving a Computational Problem

- Problem definition and specification
    - Specify input, output, and constraints
- Algorithm analysis & design
    - Devise a correct & efficient algorithm

- Implementation planning
- Coding, testing, and verification

## Examples

- RSA
    - Cryptography
- Quicksort
    - Databases
- FFT
    - Signal processing
- Huffman codes
    - Data compression
- Network flow
    - Routing internet packets
- Linear programming
    - Planning, decision-making

## What is CPSC:435?

- Learn well-known algorithms and the design and analysis of algorithms.
