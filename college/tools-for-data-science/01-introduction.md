## Statistical Learning vs. Machine Learning

- ML arose as a subfield of AI.
- SL arose as a subfield of statistics.
- *There is much overlap*- both fields focus on supervised and unsupervised problems:
    - ML has a greater emphasis on *large scale* applications and *prediction accuracy*.
    - SL emphasizes *models* and their interpretability, and *precision* and *uncertainty*.
- But the distinction has become more and more blurred, and there is a great deal of "cross-fertilization".
- ML has the upper hand in *marketing!*
